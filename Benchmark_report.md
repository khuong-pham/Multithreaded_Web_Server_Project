## Conclusion

### ‚úÖ **Strengths**
- **Linear scaling** up to optimal load (15 connections)
- **Competitive performance** for custom implementation (77 RPS peak)
- **Acceptable latency** under normal operating conditions
- **Graceful degradation** under overload conditions
- **Complete feature set** (HTTP/1.1, keep-alive, caching, threading)


### ‚ùå **Limitations**
- **Concurrency Ceiling** hardware limit at 12-15 concurrent connections due to thread pool size
- **Memory Overhead** each thread consumes stack space so much
- **Context Switching Cost** performance degradation with thread contention above optimal loads
- **Locking I/O Model** threads blocked during file operations, limiting overall throughput
